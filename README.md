This repository contains a collection of JavaScript polyfills for adding support to older browsers and environments that lack native implementations of certain features and APIs.

## How to Use 📚

1. Clone the repository or download the desired polyfill file.
2. Include the polyfill script in your web application using a script tag before your main JavaScript code.
3. Enjoy the extended functionality and compatibility across different browsers.

## Available Polyfills 🛠️

1. Array.prototype.myPush: A polyfill for the native Array.prototype.push method, which adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
2. Array.prototype.myIncludes: A polyfill for the native Array.prototype.includes method, which checks if an array includes a specific element.
3. Array.prototype.myFind: A polyfill for the native Array.prototype.find method, which returns the value of the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function.
4. Object.assign: A polyfill for the Object.assign method, which copies the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
5. Promise.prototype.finally: A polyfill for the Promise.prototype.finally method, which allows you to specify a function to be executed when a promise is settled (either resolved or rejected).
6. String.prototype.myIncludes: A polyfill for the native String.prototype.includes method, which checks if a string contains the specified substring.
